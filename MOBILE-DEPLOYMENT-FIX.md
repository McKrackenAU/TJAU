# Mobile Deployment Issues - Fixed

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed

Your mobile apps were not updating because they were configured to load content from the Replit development environment instead of your production server at www.tarotjourney.au.

## Key Fix Applied

**Capacitor Configuration Updated**
- Changed `server.url` from development URLs to `https://www.tarotjourney.au`
- Updated `webDir` to use the correct build output directory
- Added proper domain navigation permissions for production

## Specific Issues Resolved

### 1. Voice Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Mobile apps were using development voice configuration with Adam instead of Josie
- **Solution**: Production server now properly configured with ElevenLabs API for Josie voice
- **Result**: Mobile users will now hear Josie's voice in all meditations

### 2. Spread Meditation Errors Fixed
- **Problem**: Mobile apps couldn't find meditation endpoints on development server
- **Solution**: Apps now point to production API endpoints
- **Result**: Spread meditations will work properly with audio and transcripts

### 3. Slow Meditation Loading Fixed
- **Problem**: Mobile apps were connecting to slow development server
- **Solution**: Apps now use optimized production server
- **Result**: Faster meditation loading and better performance

### 4. Missing Features Fixed
- **Problem**: Mobile apps missing latest features and fixes
- **Solution**: Apps now load from production with all latest updates
- **Result**: Mobile users get same experience as web users

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Build Updated Mobile Apps**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

2. **Open Native Projects**
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios     # For iOS
   npx cap open android # For Android
   ```

3. **Update Version Numbers**
   - iOS: Update version in Xcode project
   - Android: Update version in build.gradle

4. **Build and Deploy**
   - iOS: Archive and upload to App Store Connect
   - Android: Generate signed AAB and upload to Google Play Console

## Critical Configuration Changes Made

```typescript
// OLD (Development) - CAUSING ISSUES
server: {
  allowNavigation: [
    'localhost',
    '*.replit.dev',
    '*.spock.replit.dev'
  ]
}

// NEW (Production) - FIXES ISSUES
server: {
  url: 'https://www.tarotjourney.au',
  cleartext: false,
  allowNavigation: [
    'www.tarotjourney.au',
    'tarotjourney.au',
    '*.stripe.com',
    '*.apple.com',
    'api.elevenlabs.io',
    'openai.com'
  ]
}
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

✅ **Josie's voice** will work in all meditations  
✅ **Spread meditations** will have audio and transcripts  
✅ **Faster loading** times for all features  
✅ **All latest features** available to mobile users  
✅ **Consistent experience** between web and mobile  

## Deployment Verification

After deploying the updated apps:
1. Test Daily Reading meditation - should use Josie's voice
2. Test Spread meditation - should work without errors
3. Check meditation transcripts - should display properly
4. Verify loading speeds - should be significantly faster

The core issue was that your mobile apps were essentially loading a "development version" of your app instead of the production version with all your latest improvements and proper API configurations.
