{"text":"Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, allowing your body to fully relax. Close your eyes gently, inviting a sense of peace to envelop you. Let's begin by taking a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely, and exhaling slowly, releasing any tension you may be holding. Let each breath bring you deeper into a state of calm.\n\n...... Inhale deeply, feeling the air entering your body, bringing a sense of clarity. Exhale slowly, letting go of any worries or distractions. With each breath, you are creating space for stillness and presence within yourself.\n\nImagine yourself standing in front of the Seven of Cups, a card filled with various images symbolizing different choices and possibilities. As you gaze upon the card, notice how each cup holds a different dream or desire, tempting you with its illusionary beauty.\n\n...... Visualize yourself reaching out to touch one of the cups, feeling the cool surface beneath your fingers. Each cup represents a path you could take, a fantasy waiting to be explored. Take a moment to reflect on the myriad of choices laid out before you, each one shimmering with promise.\n\nAs you continue to breathe deeply, remind yourself that not all that glitters is gold. Some paths may lead to illusion and confusion, clouding your judgment with false promises. Allow yourself to discern between what is truly fulfilling and what is merely a fleeting dream.\n\n...... Repeat after me: \"I trust my inner wisdom to guide me towards clarity and truth. I choose paths that align with my highest good and purpose.\"\n\nWith each affirmation, feel a sense of empowerment growing within you, anchoring you in the present moment and helping you navigate through the sea of possibilities.\n\n...... Take a few more deep breaths, allowing the wisdom of the Seven of Cups to sink deep into your consciousness. Know that you have the power to manifest your dreams with intention and discernment.\n\nWhen you're ready, gently start to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, feeling the sensation of being grounded in your body. Open your eyes slowly, carrying the essence of this meditation with you as you continue your day.\n\nMay you move forward with clarity and purpose, embracing the magic of choice and the beauty of authentic possibilities.","audioUrl":"/cache/meditation_c7_josie.mp3"}
