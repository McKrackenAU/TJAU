{"text":"Find a comfortable seated position, allowing your back to be straight and your hands resting gently on your lap. Softly close your eyes, inviting the stillness to embrace you.\n\nLet's begin by taking a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely, and then exhaling slowly, releasing any tension or worries. Inhale deeply once more, feeling the air nourishing every cell of your body, and exhale, letting go of any lingering thoughts. \n\nAs you continue to breathe deeply and steadily, visualize yourself standing in a vast open field. The sky above you is a brilliant blue, adorned with streaks of light, like shooting stars in motion. These are the Eight of Wands, symbols of speed, action, and movement.\n\nSense the energy of swift decisions in the air around you. With each inhale, feel yourself being filled with the dynamic force of quick choices and rapid progress. ...... \n\nImagine yourself as one of these wands, soaring through the sky with purpose and direction. Embrace the momentum of change and growth that surrounds you. ...... \n\nAs you embrace this energy, repeat silently in your mind: \"I am decisive. I am swift. I am in motion towards my goals.\" Let these affirmations resonate within you, anchoring you in the essence of the Eight of Wands. ...... \n\nFeel the wind of transformation gently guiding you forward, empowering you to make choices with clarity and confidence. Embrace the dynamic flow of life's journey. ...... \n\nNow, slowly bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, taking in a deep breath to ground yourself in the here and now. When you're ready, gently open your eyes, carrying the essence of the Eight of Wands with you as you continue your day. \n\nMay you move forward with purpose and grace.","audioUrl":"/cache/meditation_w8_josie.mp3"}
