{"text":"Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, where you can fully relax and let go. Close your eyes gently, allowing your breath to become slow and deep. Let's begin our meditation journey inspired by the Wheel of Fortune Tarot card.\n\n.........\n\nTake a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely with air, and slowly exhale, releasing any tension or worries. Feel the cycle of your breath, like the turning of a wheel, steady and calming.\n\n.........\n\nImagine yourself standing in the center of a great wheel. This wheel represents the cycles of life, the ebb and flow of destiny. You are at a turning point, where good luck and karma intersect.\n\n.........\n\nAs you stand in the center of this wheel, feel a sense of peace and acceptance washing over you. Know that everything in life has its time, its season. Trust in the universe's plan for you, for it is filled with abundance and blessings.\n\n.........\n\nReflect on the concept of destiny, of the interconnectedness of all things. Just as the wheel turns, so do the events in your life. Embrace this moment of change, for it brings growth and new opportunities.\n\n.........\n\nRepeat silently to yourself:\n\"I trust in the cycles of life.\nI am open to the blessings of good luck.\nI create my destiny with each choice I make.\"\n\n.........\n\nFeel the energy of the wheel surrounding you, guiding you towards your highest path. Let go of any resistance and surrender to the flow of life. Breathe in this sense of calm and clarity.\n\n.........\n\nSlowly, begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, feeling grounded and centered. When you are ready, gently open your eyes, carrying the essence of the Wheel of Fortune's wisdom with you.\n\nMay you move forward with grace and confidence on your journey. Peace be with you.","audioUrl":"/cache/meditation_10_josie.mp3","thetaFrequency":6.454545454545454}
