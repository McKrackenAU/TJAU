Wise mature male king with flowing liquid starlight hair and regal beard in shimmering purple and pink tones, sitting on magnificent crystalline throne while prominently holding a large ornate chalice with both hands with incredible dimensional detail. Ultra-realistic skin texture with compassionate pink ethereal glow, perfectly natural masculine facial features showing deep wisdom and emotional mastery. The chalice overflows with cosmic liquid starlight that flows down in mystical streams, showing clear cup symbolism. Translucent flowing royal robes and crown in rich musky purple and pink aurora tones. Multiple chalices and cups integrated into his throne design and royal regalia with dimensional presence. Ship sailing in distant cosmic waters with chalices reflected in the waves. Ultra-ethereal dreamlike whimsical quality. Completely original artistic interpretation. Photographic realism with magical pink purple atmosphere.";
