A cloaked figure with flowing liquid starlight hair walking away under moonlight, leaving behind EXACTLY EIGHT ornate chalices arranged neatly in the foreground. The figure moves toward distant mountains, symbolizing abandoning what no longer serves them. Translucent, dreamlike quality with cosmic winds. Background of mystical pink and purple starscape with crescent moon. The eight cups are clearly visible and prominently arranged, showing what is being left behind for spiritual growth. Ultra-realistic 3D depth, musky pink/purple palette, melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere. The card depicts spiritual journey and moving on to higher purpose.`;
