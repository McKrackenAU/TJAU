Translucent, dreamlike figures with liquid starlight hair flowing in cosmic winds. Celestial features glowing with inner light. Background of swirling pink and purple nebulae, with exactly THREE ornate golden cups prominently displayed. The scene radiates friendship, celebration, and community. Musky pink and purple color palette with golden accents. Ultra-realistic 3D depth, cinematic lighting, mystical atmosphere. The card should clearly show the number 3 and depict celebration and togetherness.`;
