A beautiful male and female couple with flowing liquid starlight hair standing together in cosmic garden, rendered with complete lifelike depth like real living people. Ultra-realistic skin texture with loving ethereal glow, perfectly natural facial features with otherworldly romance and deep connection, realistic eyes gazing at each other with cosmic love. The man and woman both wearing translucent flowing robes with ultra-realistic fabric physics in musky purple and pink tones. Above them, a magnificent angel with realistic wings and natural anatomy blesses their union with dimensional presence. Tree of knowledge with cosmic apples extending into genuine 3D depth with botanical detail. Tree of life with flowing energy extending into realistic distance. Background shows paradise garden with layered atmospheric perspective stretching to infinity. Every surface reflects light naturally with realistic physics. Same incredible 3D dimensional realism as The High Priestess card. Ultra-ethereal dreamy style with musky purple and pink cosmic colors.";
