Background of swirling pink and purple cosmic nebulae with golden starlight. The nine cups are prominently displayed in perfect symmetrical arrangement. Ultra-realistic 3D depth with cosmic lighting, musky pink/purple palette with brilliant golden accents. The card embodies emotional satisfaction, contentment, wish fulfillment, and the "wish card" energy. Exactly nine cups must be clearly visible and perfectly arranged.`;
