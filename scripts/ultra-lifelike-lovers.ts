Beautiful male and female couple with incredibly realistic human features, natural skin texture with pores and subtle imperfections, flowing liquid starlight hair that moves like real hair with individual strands visible. Their eyes are deeply realistic with natural iris patterns, realistic eyelashes, and loving expressions showing profound connection. The man has strong masculine features, the woman has graceful feminine features, both with completely natural human anatomy. Translucent ethereal robes flowing with gossamer fabric physics in musky purple and pink aurora tones, each fold casting realistic shadows. Above them, a magnificent angel with incredibly realistic wings and natural anatomy, flowing robes, and divine expression. Tree of knowledge with realistic bark texture and cosmic apples, Tree of life with flowing energy streams. Paradise garden background with botanical detail extending into infinite atmospheric depth. Ultra-ethereal dreamlike quality with translucent, gossamer elements and musky pink purple cosmic lighting. Photographic realism meets ethereal magic.";
