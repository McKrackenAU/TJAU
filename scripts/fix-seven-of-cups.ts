A translucent figure with liquid starlight hair contemplating EXACTLY SEVEN floating chalices arranged in clouds, each containing different mystical visions: a castle, a serpent, a jeweled crown, a dragon, a laurel wreath, a shadowy figure, and scattered treasure. The seven cups hover in ethereal mist showing illusions and multiple choices. Dreamlike quality with cosmic pink and purple nebulae background. Each of the SEVEN cups is clearly visible, ornate, and distinct. The scene represents fantasy, illusion, wishful thinking, and too many options. Ultra-realistic 3D depth, musky pink/purple palette, celestial lighting. Exactly seven cups must be prominently displayed and easily counted.`;
