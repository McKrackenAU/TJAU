Three joyful friends celebrating together in perfect harmony, each holding ornate chalices raised in toast. Translucent, dreamlike figures with liquid starlight hair flowing in cosmic winds. Celestial features glowing with inner light, musky pink and purple aurora skin tones. Background of swirling pink and purple nebulae with golden starlight. EXACTLY THREE ornate golden cups prominently displayed - each cup detailed with intricate celestial engravings. The scene radiates friendship, celebration, and community joy. Ultra-realistic 3D depth with cinematic lighting, mystical atmosphere. Photographic realism with magical pink purple color palette. Completely original artistic interpretation. No text or numbers on card.`;
