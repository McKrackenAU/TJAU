Wise spiritual teacher with incredibly realistic human features, natural skin texture with pores and subtle imperfections, flowing liquid starlight hair that moves like real hair with individual strands visible. His eyes are deeply realistic with natural iris patterns, realistic eyelashes, and soulful expression showing profound spiritual wisdom. Translucent ethereal robes flowing with gossamer fabric physics in musky purple and pink aurora tones, each fold casting realistic shadows. He sits on a crystalline throne with incredible material detail - you can see the crystal structure and light refraction. Two cosmic keys floating beside him with realistic metallic surfaces reflecting light naturally. Two pilgrims kneeling with completely natural human anatomy, realistic skin, hair, and clothing. Ancient temple columns with weathered stone texture extending into infinite atmospheric depth. Ultra-ethereal dreamlike quality with translucent, gossamer elements and musky pink purple cosmic lighting. Photographic realism meets ethereal magic.";
