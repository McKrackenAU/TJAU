Beautiful woman with flowing starlight hair moving naturally in cosmic breeze, rendered with complete lifelike depth. Ultra-realistic skin texture with hopeful ethereal glow, natural facial features with otherworldly grace and serene expression. Translucent flowing robes in musky purple and pink aurora tones with realistic fabric physics draping gracefully over three-dimensional form. Kneeling by cosmic pool with genuine depth reflection and realistic water physics, pouring liquid starlight from dimensional vessels casting real shadows and flowing with natural physics. Seven 3D stars floating at various depths above head, creating natural depth perception with realistic light rays and dimensional shadows. Eighth larger star shining brilliantly with dimensional illumination. Mountains of crystalline light extending into realistic distance with perfect atmospheric perspective. Skin has photorealistic texture with hopeful luminescence, natural facial features showing peaceful contemplation, realistic hair movement flowing with cosmic wind. Background with true dimensional depth, layered cosmic clouds stretching to infinity. Same incredible dimensional realism as professional photography. Ultra-ethereal style with musky purple and pink cosmic colors.",
