Beautiful ethereal woman kneeling by cosmic waters with incredibly realistic human features, natural skin texture with pores and subtle imperfections, flowing liquid starlight hair in shimmering purple and pink tones that moves like real hair with individual strands visible. Her eyes are deeply realistic with natural iris patterns, realistic eyelashes, and serene expression showing profound hope. She has completely natural human anatomy with realistic musculature and graceful posture. Translucent flowing robes in rich musky purple and pink aurora tones with ultra-realistic gossamer fabric physics casting dimensional shadows. She pours cosmic water from two crystalline vessels with incredible material detail - one vessel pouring into dimensional pool with realistic water physics, one onto mystical land with splash effects. Seven smaller stars and one magnificent large star above with incredible 3D depth, dimensional pink and purple starlight creating layered atmospheric lighting. Water pools extending into genuine infinite depth with ultra-realistic reflections showing purple and pink cosmic energy ripples. Mystical landscape with dimensional botanical elements, rocks, and terrain extending to horizon. Ultra-ethereal dreamlike whimsical quality with translucent gossamer elements floating in 3D space. Photographic realism with magical pink purple atmosphere.";
