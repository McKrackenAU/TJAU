A serene man hanging upside down by his left foot from a cosmic tree branch, his head pointing downward toward the bottom of the card. Ultra-realistic skin texture with peaceful ethereal glow, flowing liquid starlight hair falling downward due to gravity. His body is inverted with one leg bent creating figure-4 shape, arms behind his back, wearing translucent robes flowing downward with realistic fabric physics in musky purple and pink tones. Golden halo around his inverted head. The cosmic tree extends into genuine 3D depth. Same incredible dimensional realism as The High Priestess. Ultra-ethereal dreamy style with musky purple and pink cosmic colors.";
